Java applet --
    - special kind of Java program designed to be transmitted over the internet and automatically executed by a Java-compatible web browser
    - downloaded on demand
    - execute locally, rather than on server
    - (security) confined to Java execution environment, not allowed access to other parts of computer
Java Bytecode
    - highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by the Java run-time system (JVM)
    - only JVM is needed to be implemented for each platform; any Java program can run on it
    - HotSpot technology provides just-in-time (JIT) compiler (part of the JVM) for bytecode
        - selected portions of bytecode are compiled into executable code in real time; remaining code is interpreted
JVM -- Java Virtual Machine
    - interpreter for bytecode
Java Servlet
    - small program that executes on a server

Object-Oriented Programming
    - "data controlling access to code" -- define data & routines that are permitted to act on that data
    - 3 traits
        - Encapsulation
            - Java unit of encapsulation = class; code/data of class = members of the class; method = function in C/C++
            - binds together code & the data it manipulates => object(instance of class); keeps it safe from outside interference & misuse
            - within object, code/data can be public or private
        - Polymorphism
            - allows one interface to access a general class of actions
            - ie. using the same routine for different data types (int, float, string)
        - Inheritance
            - one object can acquire the properties of another object
