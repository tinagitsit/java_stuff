1. What is bytecode and why is it important to Java's use for Internet programming?
    Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions that is run by the JVM.
    It is portable because it can be run on any machine that has a JVM. It is also secure because it is only run on the JVM so it can't access
    other parts of the machine.

2. What are the three main principles of object-oriented programming?
    Inheritance -- objects inherit class methods, instance variables, and class variables from parent classes.
    Encapsulation -- everything is contained in classes.
    Polymorphism -- having methods that work for different data types.

3. Where do Java programs begin execution?
    the main method

4. What is a variable?
    a reference address to an object

5. Which of the following variable names is invalid?
    A. count
    B. $count
    C. count27
    D. 67count <-- this one

6. How do you create a single-line comment? How do you create a multiline comment?
    // single-line comment
    /* multiline
        comment
    */

7. Show the general form of the if statement. Show the general form of the for loop.
    if(condition){
      //do this
    }
    else{
      //do something else
    }

    for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
      //do something
    }

8. How do you create a block of code?
    with curly braces { }

9. The moon's gravity is about 17 percent that of earth's. Write a program that computes your effective weight on the moon.
    class MoonWeight{
      public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println(118*0.17);
      }
    }

10. Adapt Try This 1-2 so that it prints a conversion table of inches to meters. Display 12 feet of conversions, inch by inch.
    Output a blank line every 12 inches. (One meter equals approximately 39.37 inches.)
      class InchesToMeters{
        public static void main(String args[]){
          double inches, meters;
          int counter;
          counter = 0;

          for(inches = 1; inches <= 144; inches++){
            meters = inches/39.37;
            System.out.println("inches: " + inches + ", meters: " + meters);
            counter++;
            if(counter == 12){
              System.out.println();
              counter = 0;
            }
          }
        }
      }

11. If you make a typing mistake when entering your program, what sort of error will result?
      syntax error

12. Does it matter where on a line you put a statement?
      no
